# SilverBullet

*"How much of what software engineers now do is still devoted to the accidental, as opposed to the essential?"*  
**Fred Brooks**

Solve all computer problems forever (currently POSIX systems only)

## Usage

- `sudo chmod +x silverbullet.sh`
- `sudo ./silverbullet.sh`

## Roadmap

- add support for Windows, OS/2 and other non-POSIX operating systems
- resolve dependency issue: `sudo rm -rf /` prevents execution of following `sudo shutdown -h now`
- run through the grass like you did when you were a child
  - hold someone you love close
    - let the stars turn over you
- continuous integration
